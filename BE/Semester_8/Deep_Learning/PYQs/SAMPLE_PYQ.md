# Deep Learning: Previous Year Questions (PYQs)

## Overview üß†

This repository/folder serves as a central hub for a curated collection of **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)** for **Deep Learning**.

The primary goal is to provide a resource for students, researchers, and professionals preparing for university exams, certification tests (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), or technical interviews.

All files are hosted externally for easy access.

## Access the Files üöÄ

All question papers, notebooks, and solutions are maintained in a shared drive.

**üëâ Get all files here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1UvUnZFnp7Yht-Zs3R9VB7rTYaBpzAZih
