# Deep Learning: Previous Year Questions (PYQs)

## Overview 🧠

This repository/folder serves as a central hub for a curated collection of **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)** for **Deep Learning**.

The primary goal is to provide a resource for students, researchers, and professionals preparing for university exams, certification tests (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), or technical interviews.

All files are hosted externally for easy access.

## Access the Files 🚀

All question papers, notebooks, and solutions are maintained in a shared drive.

    * `Convolutional_Networks_CNN/` (Convolutions, Pooling, Architectures like VGG, ResNet)
    * `Sequential_Models_RNN/` (RNN, LSTM, GRU, Sequence-to-Sequence)
    * `Transformers/` (Attention, Self-Attention, BERT, GPT, etc.)
    * `Generative_Models/` (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models)
    * `Optimization_and_Regularization/` (Adam, RMSprop, Dropout, Batch Norm)
* **/Exams**: Full question papers sorted by the examination or university.
    * `University_XYZ_Final_2023/`
    * `DL_Certification_Mock_Test/`
* **/Solutions_and_Notebooks** (Optional): Solved papers or `.ipynb` (Jupyter/Colab) notebooks with practical implementations.

*(You can customize this section to match your actual folder structure in the drive.)*
