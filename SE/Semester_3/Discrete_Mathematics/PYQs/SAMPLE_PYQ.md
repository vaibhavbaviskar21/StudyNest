# Discrete Mathematics: Previous Year Questions (PYQs)

## Overview üìñ

This repository/folder serves as a central hub for a curated collection of **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)** for **Discrete Mathematics** (also sometimes called Discrete Structures).

The primary goal is to provide a resource for computer science students and enthusiasts preparing for university exams, competitive tests, or interviews.

All files are hosted externally for easy access.

## Access the Files üöÄ

All question papers, notes, and solutions are maintained in a shared drive.

**üëâ Get all files here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1mXQkrN4oDyoDY-K-Z4akFAVhx79hnhS3
